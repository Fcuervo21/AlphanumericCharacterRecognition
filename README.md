## Description of the content
For a better study of the system, the code was separated into various files with their appropriate documentation.

 - ðŸ“„ File "a" shows the code for image preprocessing and enhancement.
 - ðŸ“„ In file "b" is the code where the CRAFT method (Pretrained Neural Network) with OCR is found.
 - ðŸ“‚ In the image folder there is a series of images to be used as a test within the code.


## ðŸ›  Requirements

- MATLAB account
- In case of using Matlab online, the execution of the code is done directly, it is only necessary to place the correct path of the images.

- In case you are using MATLAB locally on your computer, at the moment of executing the code errors of lack of libraries will appear, for this:
    -
        - Click on the required libraries in the terminal (generally they are artificial vision libraries).
        - Install them.
